# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This assignment was to use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio of our class work. Using references to some of the classwork we have already completed as content for the responsive portfolio, HTML5 and CSS3 were coupled with elements from Bootstrap and implemented for this project.


## Project Details
Using the above mentioned technologies and code sources, the deployed application was created. The application consists of the following:

 - Navigation bar including About Me, Portfolio, Games, and Contact pages.
 - Working links to internal and external pages and contact form.
 - Responsive design and layout for each page with images and content.
 - Conistent spacing and features across all pages.
 - Special features implemented as screen sizes fell below 411px.
 - Minimum screen size optimization was set to 411px but this application worked down to 360px.
 - Minimal use of media queries.
 - Bootstrap's grid system of containers, rows, and columns, as well as carousel and card features.
 - Personalized information.
 - Sticky footer with personal contact information.  
 - Semantic HTML elements were used in a logical flow on the page and commented in the HTML file.
 - Every page passes HTML validation tool.
 - CSS sheet was updated to reflect changes in HTML.
 - CSS styles were consolidated when possible and commented for ease of use.
 
 ### Results
 The final application is optimized for screens as small as 360px. Images and page layouts respond as one would expect for all sizes of screens, whether using the development tools built into the Chrome browser, or using the actual various devices such as iPhone 5/6S+/iPad. The navigation bar works and all clickable items click through to the proper locations. The Contact form is in good working order and the sticky footer performs as expected.
